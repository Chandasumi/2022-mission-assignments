                <p>A career plan lists short- and long-term career goals and the actions you can take to achieve them.
                    Career plans can help you make decisions about what classes to take, and identify the
                    extracurricular
                    activities, research, and internships that will make you a strong job candidate.

                <p>My dream is to be a good web designer and I want to start my "Website Development Company". Because I
                    want to be an entrepreneur. At present the unemployment rate is increasing in our country. So, I
                    want to
                    reduce some unemployment and move the country towards digitalization. I want to represent my country
                    in
                    the world.</p>
